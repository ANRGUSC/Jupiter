# This script is used to time the file transfer duration using the scp tool
# This script must be called with two arguments as follows:
# $1: the remote server info. For example if the remote is 10.10.10.1, then $1 = root@10.10.10.1
# $2: the file size to be sent which is used to choose from the generated random files.
# This script also needs the IP of the sender node which is avaiable from
# the environment variable $SELF_IP
